This is where I'll store all my projects for further practice and learning.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Project (Python) 
This is just a few lines of code, where the player chooses between the 3 options by typing in r, s, or p. If they want to keep going, they can press y or any other letter
, but pressing the n key would instantly end the game. You need to download Python 3.17 and run it on IDLE. First, click File on the left-hand corner, then click New File because if you don't do that, IDLE assumes you're typing in 1 line of code. But in a new file, that's the proper way to run many lines of code! Then you can click Run Without Debugging to start your game!
